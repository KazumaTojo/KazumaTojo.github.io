Togglable button implemented by JavaScript.

I carefully implement tbose according below.

- UI(css transition speed, comfortability)
- generatable by js

I thought those togglable button, originally inspired by Proto.io, try to implement by js. By implementing js and buttons become generatable by js at any times, HTML becomes very clean.
