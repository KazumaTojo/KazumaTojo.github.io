Toggle Switcher is implemented by JavaScript.

I carefully implement it according to below points.

- UI(css transition speed, comfortability)
- generatable by js

I thought those toggle switcher, originally inspired by [Proto.io —On/Off FlipSwitch—](https://proto.io/freebies/onoff/), try to implement by JavaScript. By implementing JavaScript and switchers become generatable by js at any times, HTML becomes more clean.
