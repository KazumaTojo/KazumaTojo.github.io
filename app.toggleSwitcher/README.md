Toggle Switcher is implemented by JavaScript.

I carefully implement it according to below points.

- UI(css transition speed, comfortability)
- generatable by js

I thought tring to implement those toggle switcher, originally inspired by [Proto.io —On/Off FlipSwitch—](https://proto.io/freebies/onoff/), by JavaScript. As switchers is implemented JavaScript and generatable by js, HTML becomes more clean. In adittion, you are enable to generate any switchers as you want by just invoking generator.
